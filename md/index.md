### Ownership and Borrowing

- [Hello World](src/hello_world.rs):
    - Goal: make it greet you by name
    - Time: 3 minutes
- [Ownership](src/ownership.rs):
    - Goal #1: Get code to compile
    - Goal #2: Convert so that it prints the original string before removing vowels
      as well as the "devowelized" version.
    - Extra credit: Can you do it without copying any data?
    - Time: 10 minutes
- [Shared borrows](src/shared-borrow.rs):
    - Goal #1: Convert code to use borrowing, not cloning.
    - Goal #2: Use slices to print "Hello, friend" and not "Hello, my friend".
    - Time: 10 minutes
- [Mutable borrows](src/mutable-borrow.rs):
    - Goal: convert `strcat` function so that it uses borrowing, not ownership.
    - [Hint:](hint-mutable-borrow-1.html) Getting the syntax just right can
      be a bit tricky if you've never done any Rust
      before. [If you need a hint, click here](hint-mutable-borrow-1.html).
    - Time: 10 minutes
- [Structs](src/structs.rs)
    - Goal: implement `total_price` method
    - Time: 10 minutes

### Traits and Threads

- [Threads](src/threads.rs)
    - Goal: join the threads and print out the store with the best price
    - Extra credit #1: use channels instead
    - Extra credit #2: or, instead of channels, use a mutex to compute the best price in
      the parallel threads themselves
    - Time: 10 minutes

### Advanced Lifetimes

- Ensure you are using **Nightly builds** for the best error messages.
- Exercises are listed in the source code.

- [Named lifetime parameters](src/named_lifetime_parameters.rs):
- [Lifetimes as part of the type](src/lifetimes_as_part_of_type.rs):
- [Successful borrowing](src/successful_borrowing.rs):
