# Install Rust

Install Rust using:
<https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html>

If you installed using Rustup, you now have the Rust toolchain manager installed. That's good!

## Important commands:

Install a toolchain:

```
rustup install stable
```

Download all of Rust's standard library documentation:

```
rustup component add rust-docs
```

Open documentation in the browser:

```
rustup doc
```

Check version of the installed compiler:

```
rustc --version
```


## Rust without installation

You can use Rust through the playground in the browser.
